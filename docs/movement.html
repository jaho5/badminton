  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In badminton, it&rsquo;s generalized that the two most important aspects are movement and shots. Movement in badminton is like what working is to living. You need to work to buy food, and you can benefit from how efficient you work. Movement is essential to badminton in this same way. So, let&rsquo;s learn about movement. Note that the technical term for how to move is footwork.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movement is what it sounds: movement around the court. There&rsquo;s movement to retrieve a shot and there&rsquo;s movement to recover and be ready for a shot. In singles, the position to be ready for a shot is roughly in the center of the court, but it can change depending on where the shot is and how fast the shot is. </span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movement to being in position is like an anticipation, reaction game of chess against the opponent&rsquo;s movement and shot. It is an active game of deciding when to be passive and when to be active. When you&rsquo;re passive, you save energy but are less likely to be able to attack. Too passive and the opponent can control the game. Too active and the game feels like a long sprint. So, how do players choose their ready position?</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprisingly, depending on their shot quality and opponent&rsquo;s movement. Hit the shuttlecock tight to the net and the position will be closer to the net. The opponent&rsquo;s possible shot will be closer to the net or high to the back since it will be hard to push a tight net shot. General positioning is same as the trajectory as the shot; hit to the back and position is slightly back and so on. When in position, the player can then more easily apply shot retrieval movement. </span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shot retrieval movement is quite technical. It requires the right foot positioning and efficient body movement to get to the shuttlecock in time and ready to play a shot. It consists of running, lunging, shuffling, backing-up, turning, skipping, and even diving. In order to perform these movements, a player has to decide how much to lower their center of gravity. Lowering the center of gravity enables easier side movement which is a good body position for backcourt shots. However, it makes the body stiffer and more difficult to get unexpected shots. </span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is this combination of court position, body position, and body movements that is movement which enables effective play in badminton. The fluid steps and creative positionings makes badminton movement an elegant thing to see. At the same time, powerful jumps, lunges, and dives demonstrate remarkable athleticism. </span></p>
