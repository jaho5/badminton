<div class="container-fluid bg-2 text-center">
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we have a video from Lee Jae Bok. He is a player from Korea, has been the korean national team and english national team coach, and is currently coaching in Canada. </span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this video, Lee Jae Bok is teaching a trick for the grip of the forehand smash. He explains that the typical forehand grip is wrong, because if you want to hit the shuttlecock in front of you, the racket face would not be head on causing the shot to be sliced. So, he teaches his solution to turn the racket 10 degrees in the hand so that the stroke would produce a head on smash without having to turn the body to the side. </span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I agree with the concepts of hitting head on, grip depending on shot, and hitting relative to body. By hitting head on, power isn&rsquo;t dissipated and as a result, there&rsquo;s more of it. The shuttlecock is at different places at different times, so it makes sense to use a grip that&rsquo;s aimed to hit at different places. You use the body to play sports, so you should generate power the way the body is comfortable generating power. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I explain why I don&rsquo;t completely agree with him, I think it&rsquo;s good to note that he says that the grip depends on the shot at the beginning of the video.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with the solution itself of changing the grip 10 degrees. In my 7 years of experience playing, I&rsquo;ve tried many different ways of hitting the smash. I&rsquo;ve tried the 10 degree change grip when I was a beginner and as an experienced player. For me, the 10 degree change grip seems to work best when the shuttlecock is at a distance in front of you that almost requires jumping forward. However, Lee bases the smash shot with the shuttlecock in optimal position which is slightly in front of you. When the shuttlecock is in that position, I believe that the typical grip produces a stronger smash by rotating the shoulder more during the shot. This is because the shoulder is able to take more load than the arm allowing more force to be generated. This is apparent in slow motion videos of high speed smashes of professionals.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite my disagreement in form, since power is involved, I can understand why he approaches teaching in this way. For a beginner, this method requires less parts of the body moving while producing high power because the shuttlecock is more likely to be hit head on. This, thereby allows more enjoyment in the sport which is truly important for beginners. </span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that reason, my opinion of the video is still quite positive. I really appreciated the video as a beginner, because I was able to hit more smashes that I could feel. And, although it seems the video is misleading players, the fundamental concepts in the video are still applicable. In conclusion, the video is helpful for beginners and provides a different way to think about the badminton grip for smashing.</span></p>
