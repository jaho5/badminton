  <h3 class="margin">About</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Jason Kaming Ho. On this website, I will be introducing basic concepts in badminton, and I will provide my interpretation of them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am currently a junior at the University of California, San Diego. I&rsquo;ve been playing badminton since my freshman year of high school. I was in my high school team, and am currently in the club team at UCSD. As a high school student, I went to practice 2-4 times a week during spring season from sophomore to senior year. I started competing in varsity my junior year and continued into senior year. In UCSD, I&rsquo;ve went to virtually all practices and open gym times equating to 4 times a week every fall, winter, and spring quarter. As a freshman, I received the Most Improved recognition, and as a junior, I received the Most Dedicated recognition. Since entering college, I&rsquo;ve competed at various badminton tournaments in Southern California including, the Anteater Collegiate Championships at UC Irvine, the Bruin Open at UCLA, the Sun God Badminton Tournament at UCSD, and the Collegiate Nationals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think badminton is a very enjoyable sport and a good source of exercise. I would definitely like to see a larger number of badminton enthusiasts in the United States. And I hope that, by going through my site, you will learn to view badminton as a technical, athletic, and passionate sport. It is an exciting sport which I care about, and I would love to see it grow. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I think that to fully appreciate any sport, you need to experience it on the court or in the field. Badminton is dedicatedly an indoor sport despite being commonly played as a backyard activity. This is due to the weight and shape of the shuttlecock being strongly affect by wind. So, once at an indoor court, you can see and feel the unique trajectory of a shuttlecock which is honestly, the real essence of badminton. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, if you get the chance to see high-level players on video (which it in itself requires a courtside view to feel the speed and power) or in person on court, you can realize the difference in body movement, shot quality, and power of the sport compared to when played in the backyard. The sport is both very technical and physical, and with this site, I hope to bridge your understanding of what you see and do on the badminton court.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as a disclaimer, most interpretation of sport and badminton on the site will be strictly from me, a non-professional, and I highly encourage understanding concepts of badminton and sport from the perspective of professionals and coaches. And, in attempts of playing badminton, don&rsquo;t disregard the possibility of injury.</span></p>
